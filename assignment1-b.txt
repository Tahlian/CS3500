Part to email

For each site your group should rate each web site on these 7 areas
a ranking (1-10 unique) for the website an three suggestions for improvement..
Then email me a plain text file of the following format with 10 evaluations
each separated by a blank line:

1) Improvement 1
2) Improvement 2
3) Improvement 3

Note the first line of each evaluation is 9 space separated integers
and the next three parts are sentences... Your email should contain
all 10 evaluations in a single text file, including a self evaluations.
